Assemblers:
1. Error handling:
    a. input file does not exist
    b. input file cannot be read
    c. output file cannot be written to if exists
    d. label name is not defined
    e. label name is duplicated
    f. Malformed instruction
2. compiling:
    a. range of commands and their binary representations
    b. removes the correct empty lines and comments
    c. can output the correct hex file.

ADD and SUB -> check that it properly handles overflow and underflow (0-255 allowed only)
make sure all commands works properly in the emulator.
check whether the assembler and emulator can handle absolute and relative paths
-> python3 assembler.py --hex /Users/janniklu/Documents/INFO1112/INFO1112emulator/testingPaths/echo.asm testingPaths/echoFromAbs.hex
-> python3 assembler.py --hex testingPaths/echo.asm testingPaths/echoFromRelative.hex


All assumptions in specs:
1. Assume an assembly file can contain at most 256 instructions
2. Assume the ASCII value of <value> char is in range [32,127]
3. Assume <value> given will always be in [0,256)
4.
